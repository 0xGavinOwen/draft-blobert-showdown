### Draft Blobert-Showdown

This is a game for [DojoJam4](https://itch.io/jam/dojo-game-jam-4), with the Blobert/Realms track.

We are adapting from the popular game [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/) onto Blobert in hopes of using it as a base game for our on-chain Reinforcement Learning training and integration framework that will be built subsequently. It will serve as good UI/UX studies for future turn-based games that would like to add a RL/AI model Bot v Bot module to their project.
